How to Collaborate on the ShieldCoin Project

1. Setting Up the Environment:

Ensure all students have the necessary development tools installed, such as a text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code), version control system (e.g., Git), and a local blockchain development framework (e.g., Truffle Suite).

Create a shared repository on a platform like GitHub, documentation, and project updates can be accessed and managed collaboratively.

2. Project Structure:

Organize the project into clear directories and subdirectories. For example:

```sh
├── contracts/    # Smart contracts
├── tests/        # Testing scripts
├── migrations/   # Deployment scripts
├── src/          # Frontend code (if applicable)
├── docs/         # Documentation
└── README.md     # Project overview
```
3. Task Assignment:

Break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks.  

GitHub Projects to track progress and deadlines.

4. Version Control:

Use Git for version control. 

Familiarize with basic Git commands, such as cloning a repository, creating branches, committing changes, pushing updates, and merging branches.

Follow a branching strategy to manage contributions. For example:

main branch: Contains the stable, production-ready code.

develop branch: Contains the latest development code.

Feature branches: Created for individual features or tasks (e.g., feature/smart-contract, feature/frontend).

5. Code Review and Testing:

Implement a code review process. Before merging any changes into the develop or main branch, ensure that code is reviewed by at least one other team member.

Write and run tests for smart contracts and other code components. Use testing frameworks like Mocha, Chai, or Truffle's built-in testing tools.

6. Documentation:

Maintain comprehensive documentation for the project. This should include an overview of ShieldCoin, setup instructions, contribution guidelines, and a detailed explanation of the codebase.

Update the README file with the latest project information and instructions for setting up the development environment.

7. Communication:

Use whatsapp group for communication.

8. Learning Resources:

Enhance your understanding of blockchain technology, smart contracts, and collaborative development. 
Some useful resources include online courses, tutorials, and documentation from platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and the official documentation of tools and frameworks.
